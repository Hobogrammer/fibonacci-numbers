Fibonacci Numbers
===

Forgotten all the math you learned your calculus classes? Wish there was some sort of magical calculator that would spit out a Fibonacci number given any number? Well today is your lucky day!

note, this project will be going with the classical math definition where Fibonacci(0) = 0

Using this script
---
Simply create a new instance of the  `Fibonacci` class and use the `calculate` method to get the fibonacci number for that  position in the sequence

    fib = Fibonacci.new
    number = fib.calculate(10) #=>  55
